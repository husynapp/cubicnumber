# Cubic Number Generator 

I have learnt a new way of calculating cubic root without using a calculator from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds8ijPsg26g

I thought I'd apply this to create my project where it generates a random cubic number, and you will have to guess the cubic root number

So used JFrame to create it in 40 minutes. Haven't used any Software Architecture or Model View Controller in this
